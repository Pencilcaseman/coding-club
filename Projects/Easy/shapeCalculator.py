Shape Area and Volume Calculator

Write a program which allows the user to enter the name of
a shape and then prints the area/volume of the shape. If the
shape entered was not valid, the program should output this
and terminate.

For example, the input for a square should be:

What shape would you like? >>> square
What is the side-length of the square? >>> 5
Area: 25.0

You should support the following shapes (you may need to
research the equations for the different shapes)

 - Square (area)
 - Rectangle (area)
 - Circle (area)
 - Trapezium (area)
 - Cube (volume)
 - Cuboid (volume)
 - Sphere (volume)
