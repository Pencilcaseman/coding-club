Simple Calculator

Write a program which:
 - Asks for an operation
	- addition
	- subtraction
	- multiplication
	- division
	- power
 - Asks the user for two numbers
	- These should be floats, not integers
 - Prints the result of the calculation

Extension:
 - Ensure the input is valid
 - Support sine, cosine, tangent, etc.
 - Check for an invalid operation and warn the user
	- E.g. division by zero
	- E.g. tan(90)
 - Allow the user to type "pi" as an input and process it correctly
