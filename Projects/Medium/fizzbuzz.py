Fizz Buzz

Task:

Write a program which loops through the numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and
print each number. The number must not be printed if:
    - It is divisible by 3; Then it needs to print "Fizz",
    - It is divisible by 5; Then it needs to print "Buzz",
    - It is divisible by both 3 and 5; Then it needs to print "FizzBuzz".
